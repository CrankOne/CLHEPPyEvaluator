# Python Interface for CLHEP Evaluator

This package provides a Python wrapper of the CLHEP's runtime arithmetic
evaluator. Though the own value of this package as a standalone solution is
negligible, its goal is to provide bitwise compatibility between the Python
utilities and C/C++ applications utilizing CLHEP library.
